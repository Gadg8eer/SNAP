### When it doesn't matter what the specific trait is, only that it makes the ruler into that character.
### If the leader has one of these leader traits, this triggers the startup sequence for Gadg8eer as ruler.

### The default version of the character.
### Thematically, has a few Ninjala, Tomato Adventure, Codename: Kids Next Door and Splatoon references. I really do have a childish taste towards fiction.
### What do you expect? lol
ursip_is_basic_gadgeteer = {
	pre_triggers = {
		has_owner = yes				# whether the leader exists and is alive
		is_idle = no				# whether the leader is idle
	}
	trigger = {
		AND = {
			ursip_is_gadg8eer = true
			who = {
				event_target:Gadg8eer = {
					has_ruler_trait = leader_trait_ursip_codygibling_gadg8eer
				}
		}
	}
	
}

### Named after the ability from GURPS 3e.
### Thematically, basically every super genius boy you saw in a 1990s cartoon.
ursip_is_quick_gadgeteer = {
	pre_triggers = {
		has_owner = yes				# whether the leader exists and is alive
		is_idle = no				# whether the leader is idle
	}
	trigger = {
		AND = {
			ursip_is_gadg8eer = true
			who = {
				event_target:Gadg8eer = {
					has_ruler_trait = leader_trait_ursip_codygibling_quick_gadg8eer
				}
		}
	}
}

### When it doesn't matter what the specific trait is, only that it follows the typical upgrade path.
ursip_is_normalupgrade_gadg8eer = {
	pre_triggers = {
		has_owner = yes				# whether the leader exists and is alive
		is_idle = no				# whether the leader is idle
	}
	trigger = {
		AND = {
			ursip_is_gadg8eer = true
			who = {
				event_target:Gadg8eer = {
					OR = {

					}
					NOT = {
						has_ruler_trait = trait_conceptoid
					}
				}
		}
	}
}

### Thematically, references to Dark Cloud 2 (Dark Chronicle in JP and PAL regions), No Game No Life and Digimon Frontier.
### Named after the Isekai Hero ability- I mean, the "Social Gadgeteer" ability from GURPS 3e.
ursip_is_gadgeteer_isekai_protag = {
	pre_triggers = {
		has_owner = yes				# whether the leader exists and is alive
		is_idle = no				# whether the leader is idle
	}
	trigger = {

			ursip_is_gadg8eer = true
			who = {
				event_target:Gadg8eer = {
					has_ruler_trait = leader_trait_ursip_codygibling_social_gadg8eer
				}
		}
	}
}

### When it doesn't matter what the specific trait is, only that it can be achieved in the same savegame as the basic version.
### Contains all three traits named after those in GURPS 3e
ursip_is_GURPS_gadg8eer = {
	pre_triggers = {
		has_owner = yes				# whether the leader exists and is alive
		is_idle = no				# whether the leader is idle

							has_ruler_trait = trait_conceptoid
						}
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
}

### Thematically, mostly a No Game No Life reference. Mostly. There's a lot more of Nobilis 3e in this than you'd expect.
### After all, Tet wasn't the only character to bear a title of the "God of Play".
ursip_is_gadg8eer_tetlike = {
	pre_triggers = {
		has_owner = yes				# whether the leader exists and is alive

				}
			}
		}
	}
}

### Who knows what really happens when a video game starts to glitch?
### That's right, Scotty, we're doing cheap fanservice now!
### Thematically, full of references for everything from TRON to ReBoot to MegaMan Battle Network to Watch_dogs to The Finals. And yes, Glitch Techs. If it involves computers heavily, it's probably on the list.
ursip_is_gadg8eer_vidjateer = {
	pre_triggers = {

						}

					}
				}
			}
		}
	}
}

### Normally I really don't like the SCP Foundation's canon, but something about the Oneiroi Collective was just plain interesting and the Conceptoids pretty much are that but in Stellaris
### Thematically, leans heavily into anything and everything that takes place in or is themed around dreams.
ursip_is_oneiroid_westerner = {
	pre_triggers = {
		has_owner = yes				# whether the leader exists and is alive

					}
					has_ruler_trait = trait_conceptoid
				}
			}
		}
	}
}

### If he turns 86, that's it. He's dead. If he gets fired, he also dies. If he dies, the trigger fires.
ursip_is_deadbutessential_ursip_codygibling_gadg8eer = {
	pre_triggers = {

								leader_age > 85

					}
				}

	}
}

### If he would have died of old age, but is immortal without eternal youth, this trigger fires.
ursip_is_deadbutimmortal_ursip_codygibling_gadg8eer = {

### If he would be older than 10, but is a Conceptoid, this trigger fires.
ursip_is_deadbutdreaming_ursip_codygibling_gadg8eer = {
