# This file is part of the Stellaris Novelty Avatar Portraits (SNAP) mod for Stellaris. Avatar as in "a persona" or "a VR metaverse avatar", not the Na'vi clones in the James Cameron movies (nor anything to do with the Nickelodeon animated series "The Last Airbender" either for that matter). It basically makes anything you can depict lore-friendly by implying that anything impossible is exclusive to a simulated "metaverse".
